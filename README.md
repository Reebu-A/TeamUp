TeamUp
TeamUp is a comprehensive platform built with Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Thymeleaf, designed to streamline turf bookings and manage sports activities. The application is divided into three modules: User, Admin, and TurfOwner.

User Module: Users can sign up, create game alerts to gather players for sports like football and box cricket, book turfs for specific time slots, and manage their booking history. Users can also invite others to join their games through alerts and book turfs once the team is complete. Alerts can be deleted, and notifications are sent to others who may be interested.

TurfOwner Module: TurfOwners can register, add new turfs with images and descriptions, manage their listings by updating or deleting turfs, review booking requests, and update their profile details. They also have the ability to set different rates for standard and peak hours.

Admin Module: Admins have oversight of all activities within the platform. They can approve or deactivate users and TurfOwners, manage game alerts, and view the history of alerts and bookings. Admins also have the authority to deactivate alerts when necessary.

TeamUp simplifies the process of finding, booking, and managing sports venues while fostering community engagement through collaborative sports activities.
